# Tasks: Phase 1 — Spec 1: Docusaurus Initialization & Configuration

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-docusaurus-init-config/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- Paths shown below are relative to the project root.

## Phase 1: Setup (Project Initialization & Basic Structure)

**Purpose**: Preparing the environment and ensuring a Docusaurus project is present, initializing one if necessary.

- [X] T001 Check if a Docusaurus project exists in the `frontend/` directory by verifying the presence of `frontend/package.json` and `frontend/docusaurus.config.ts`.
- [X] T002 If a Docusaurus project does not exist, initialize a new Docusaurus project using `npx create-docusaurus@latest . classic --typescript` within the `frontend/` directory.
- [X] T003 Navigate to `frontend/` and install Node.js dependencies using `npm install`.

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented.

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete.

- [X] T004 Validate the basic Docusaurus folder structure in `frontend/` as per `specs/001-docusaurus-init-config/plan.md`.
- [X] T005 Run `npm start` in `frontend/` to verify initial Docusaurus homepage rendering and accessibility.

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Initial Project Setup (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: As a project developer, I need to have a properly initialized Docusaurus project so that I can begin creating textbook content and integrate other UI components.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running `npm start` in the `/frontend` directory and observing a correctly rendered Docusaurus homepage, along with verifying the folder structure.

### Implementation for User Story 1

- This user story is primarily covered by the foundational tasks (T001-T005) which ensure a working Docusaurus project. No further specific implementation tasks are needed directly under this user story beyond verification.

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Configured for Textbook Structure (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: As a content author, I need the Docusaurus configuration to support multiple modules and chapters with clear navigation and mobile responsiveness so that the textbook is well-organized, readable, and accessible on various devices.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating through the Docusaurus site on both desktop and mobile viewports, confirming that modules and chapters are correctly displayed in the navigation and that the layout adapts responsively.

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [X] T006 [P] [US2] Configure the Docusaurus theme in `frontend/docusaurus.config.ts` for a clean and readable layout, applying principles from `specs/001-docusaurus-init-config/research.md`.
- [X] T007 [P] [US2] Configure the Docusaurus navbar in `frontend/docusaurus.config.ts` to support project navigation, including a link to the main documentation.
- [X] T008 [P] [US2] Configure the Docusaurus sidebar in `frontend/sidebars.ts` to represent 4 modules and 14 chapters, using either autogenerated sidebars with `_category_.json` or explicit definitions as detailed in `specs/001-docusaurus-init-config/data-model.md` and `specs/001-docusaurus-init-config/research.md`.
- [X] T009 [P] [US2] Ensure Docusaurus routing and base paths are correctly configured in `frontend/docusaurus.config.ts`.
- [X] T010 [P] [US2] Create or update `frontend/src/css/custom.css` to ensure clean typography, proper spacing, and mobile responsiveness.
- [X] T011 [P] [US2] Ensure the `frontend/docs/` folder structure supports 4 modules and 14 chapters, including adding placeholder `_category_.json` files for each module, as detailed in `specs/001-docusaurus-init-config/data-model.md`.
- [X] T012 [P] [US2] Verify static assets support by checking existing image paths (e.g., in `frontend/static/` and `frontend/docs/`) and ensuring they render correctly when the development server is running.

## Phase 5: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Fine-tuning and final validation.

- [X] T013 Confirm all Docusaurus `onBrokenLinks` and `onBrokenMarkdownLinks` configurations in `frontend/docusaurus.config.ts` are set to `'throw'` for strict checking during development.
- [X] T014 Run `npm start` in `frontend/` and perform a comprehensive visual inspection of navigation (navbar, sidebar), content rendering, and mobile responsiveness across different viewports (desktop, mobile).

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately.
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories.
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion.
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 -> P1 -> ...)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete.

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories.
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Should be independently testable.

### Within Each User Story

- Implementation tasks are ordered logically to minimize dependencies.
- Story complete before moving to next priority.

### Parallel Opportunities

- Tasks T006 through T012 within User Story 2 are marked as parallelizable. They address different configuration aspects and can be worked on concurrently.

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1.  Complete Phase 1: Setup.
2.  Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories).
3.  **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently by running `npm start` and verifying the homepage.
4.  Deploy/demo if ready.

### Incremental Delivery

1.  Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready.
2.  Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!).
3.  Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1.  Team completes Setup + Foundational together.
2.  Once Foundational is done, different team members can tackle parallelizable tasks within User Story 2.

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
