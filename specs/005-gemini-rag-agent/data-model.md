# Data Model: Agent Development (Gemini-Powered RAG Agent)

This document outlines the key entities and their structures relevant to the Gemini-powered RAG agent.

## 1. User Message

Represents the natural language text input received from the user via the chat endpoint.

*   **`text`** (String): The user's message or query.

## 2. Agent Response

Represents the natural language text output generated by the Gemini agent in response to a user message.

*   **`text`** (String): The agent's generated response.

## 3. Retrieval Tool

*   **`parameters`** (Object): The parameters passed to the retrieval tool (e.g., `query`, `top_k`, `filters`).
*   **`output`** (String): The formatted context string returned by the retrieval tool.

## 4. Conversation History

Represents the ongoing dialogue between the user and the agent, used to maintain conversational context for the Gemini model.

*   **`role`** (String): Either "user" or "model".
*   **`parts`** (Array of Objects):
    *   **`text`** (String): The message content.
    *   *(Optional)* **`function_call`** (Object): For tool calls made by the agent.
    *   *(Optional)* **`function_response`** (Object): For tool responses received by the agent.
