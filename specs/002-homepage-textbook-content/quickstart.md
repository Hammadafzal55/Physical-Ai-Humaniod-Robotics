# Quickstart: Homepage UI & Textbook Content Management

This guide provides a quick overview of how to manage the Docusaurus homepage UI and textbook content for the AI-Native Textbook. It covers editing the homepage, creating/extending textbook chapters, and preparing for Vercel deployment.

## 1. Prerequisites

-   A working Docusaurus development environment (assumed to be set up from Spec 1).
-   Node.js dependencies installed (`npm install` in `frontend/`).

## 2. Editing the Homepage UI

The homepage is primarily defined in `frontend/src/pages/index.tsx`.

1.  **Locate the Homepage File**:
    ```
    frontend/src/pages/index.tsx
    ```
2.  **Understand its Structure**: This is a React component. You can modify the JSX within this file to change the layout, text, and components displayed on the homepage.
    -   Look for the `<HeroSection>` (or similar) to change the main title, tagline, and call-to-action buttons.
    -   The `<HomepageFeatures>` component (if used) is typically defined in `frontend/src/components/HomepageFeatures/index.tsx` and can be customized there.
3.  **Make Changes**: Edit the text, update component props, or add new React components to achieve the desired minimal and readable UI.
4.  **Live Preview**: Run `npm start` in the `frontend/` directory to see your changes in real-time.

## 3. Creating or Extending Textbook Content

Textbook content is organized into Markdown files (`.md`) within the `frontend/docs/` directory.

### Guidelines:

-   **DO NOT OVERWRITE EXISTING CONTENT**: Only add new chapters or append content to existing chapters.
-   **Minimum 150 Lines**: Each chapter must contain at least 150 lines of detailed, technical content.
-   **Include Rich Media**: Add external reference links, images, diagrams, and tables where appropriate.
-   **Structured & Educational**: Maintain a structured, educational writing style suitable for advanced learners.

### 3.1. Adding a New Chapter

1.  **Identify Target Module**: Navigate to the module directory where you want to add a new chapter (e.g., `frontend/docs/Module-1-ROS 2/`).
2.  **Create Markdown File**: Create a new `.md` file (e.g., `new-chapter-title.md`) in the module directory.
3.  **Add Frontmatter**: Include YAML frontmatter at the top of the file:
    ```markdown
    ---
    sidebar_position: 5 # Adjust position to fit logically within the module
    title: Your New Chapter Title
    sidebar_label: Your New Chapter
    ---

    # Your New Chapter Title

    Start writing your detailed and technical content here.
    Ensure it is at least 150 lines long.

    ## Sub-section

    Include external [links](https://example.com), ![images](/img/example.png),
    and tables:

    | Header 1 | Header 2 |
    |----------|----------|
    | Data 1   | Data 2   |
    ```
4.  **Update `sidebars.ts` (if using explicit definitions)**: If the sidebar is not fully autogenerated, you might need to manually add the new chapter's ID to the relevant module's `items` array in `frontend/sidebars.ts`. However, if `_category_.json` files are used, it might autogenerate.

### 3.2. Extending an Existing Chapter

1.  **Locate Chapter File**: Open the Markdown file (`.md`) of the chapter you wish to extend.
2.  **Append Content**: Scroll to the end of the file and add your new content. This ensures no existing work is overwritten.
3.  **Maintain Standards**: Ensure the appended content also adheres to the 150-line minimum (if extending a short chapter), and includes links, images, etc.

## 4. Managing Static Assets

Images and other static files are typically stored in `frontend/static/img/`.

-   **Adding Images**: Place new image files (e.g., `.png`, `.jpg`, `.svg`) into `frontend/static/img/`.
-   **Referencing in Markdown**: Use the Markdown syntax `![Alt Text](/img/your-image.png)` where `/img/your-image.png` refers to the image in `frontend/static/img/your-image.png`.

## 5. Vercel Deployment

The frontend is designed to be 100% Vercel-ready.

1.  **Build the Project**: Before deployment, ensure your Docusaurus project builds successfully:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run build
    ```
    This command generates a static `build/` directory within `frontend/`.
2.  **Deploy via Vercel CLI/Platform**:
    -   If using Vercel CLI:
        ```bash
        cd frontend
        vercel deploy # or vercel --prod
        ```
    -   If deploying via Vercel platform: Ensure your Vercel project is linked to your Git repository (`main` branch) and the build command is `npm run build` and the output directory is `frontend/build`. Vercel should automatically detect Docusaurus.

The Docusaurus build is fully static, so no special server-side configurations should be needed for Vercel.

## 6. Verifying Theming and Layout

After making UI or content changes, always perform a visual check:

1.  Run `npm start` in `frontend/`.
2.  **Homepage**: Check readability, layout, and mobile responsiveness.
3.  **Documentation Pages**: Verify full viewport height for sidebars (left and right Table of Contents).
4.  **Theme Consistency**: Switch between Light, Dark, and System themes (if supported by your OS/browser) and ensure Navbar, Documentation pages, and Sidebars apply consistently without any style mismatches.
5.  **Vercel Deployment**: Deploy to a Vercel preview URL and verify all aspects on the live site.
